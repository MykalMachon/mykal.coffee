I was just sitting in a kickoff meeting with ~15 people and noticed that there seemed to be a bit of jargon-chaining happening. 
You know, people dropping buzzword after buzzword, followed by other people also dropping buzzword after buzzword to one up each other. 

> I think that we can really get some team synergy (1x) on this, and develop a real value-add(2x) for our stakeholders through technocracy(3x). 

> I couldn't agree more <insert-name>, This project will bring a level of hyperautomation(1x) that will enable massive value(2x) and hyper-growth(3x) in our content systems. 
> We will also be disrupting(4x) our internal process and pivoting(5x) into a cloud-native(6x) infrastructure. 

*PERFECT COMBO*

Just imagine a combo counter in the bottom right of these meetings; it would be a thing of beauty.
