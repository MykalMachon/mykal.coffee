I was just sitting in a kickoff meeting with ~15 people and noticed that there seemed to be a bit of jargon-chaining happening. 
You know, people dropping buzzword after buzzword, followed by other people also dropping buzzword after buzzword to one up each other.

*PERFECT COMBO*

Just imagine a combo counter in the bottom right of these meetings; it would be a thing of beauty.
