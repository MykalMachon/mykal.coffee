  # Mykal's coffee blog
A coffee blog, by [mykal machon](https://mykal.codes). This website has a bunch of stuff including: 

- Pictures of my coffee
- Updates on my coffee knowledge
- Reviews of local coffee shops
- Recipes for coffee at home 
- Coffee tools and timers

The site doesn't have much on it right now, but I'll be updating it over the coming weeks.
