I found this [fluid typescale calculator](https://www.fluid-type-scale.com/) by [Aleksandr Hovhannisyan](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/) through the [Shop Talk Show discord](https://www.patreon.com/shoptalkshow) 
awhile ago, and have been using it pretty extensively in projects since then (it's even on this site!)

It makes setting up a type scale system that scales with window size trivial and gives you a bunch of sliders to mess around and see your results right on the page.
Little tools that encourage experimentation like this seem to always send me down learning rabbit holes. In messing with settings I've learned a whole lot about css clamp!
